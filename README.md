# Analysis of Gears with Finite Elements and Comparison of Results with AGMA Standards

This project is aimed at analyzing the behavior of gears using finite element analysis and comparing the results with the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) standards.

The project will involve the following steps:

1. Establishing a finite element model of the gear system.
2. Performing a static analysis of the gear system to determine the stresses and deflections.
3. Comparing the results of the finite element analysis with the AGMA standards.
4. Identifying any areas of improvement in the design of the gear system.

The project will require the use of a finite element software package such as ANSYS or ABAQUS. The results of the analysis will be presented in the form of graphs, tables and diagrams.

The project is expected to provide insight into the behavior of gears and how they can be designed to meet the AGMA standards. It will also provide a better understanding of the effects of different design parameters on the performance of the gear system.
